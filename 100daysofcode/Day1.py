I am signing up for the Replit's 100 days of Python challenge!
I will make sure to spend some time everyday coding along, for a minimum of 10 minutes a day. I'll be using Replit, and amazing online IDE so I can do this from my phone wherever I happen to be. No excuses for not coding from the middle of a field!!
